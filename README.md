# SuperText
Built a text-based Java web app using the Spark framework, APIs from Twilio and IBM Bluemix
Based on the tutorial found at https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/getting-started-with-gradle-and-the-spark-framework-3.html

This web app has two features: 

• Searching musics that chosen by the user via text from Spotify and playing the musics via phone calls
  
• Translating phrases via text.
